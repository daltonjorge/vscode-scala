# Scala Syntax (DEPRECATED!) :disappointed_relieved:

Note: This extension has been deprecated in favor of the **[Scala Syntax (official)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scala-lang.scala)** extension :smiley::+1:. 

**[Please, install this excellent extension from Scala Group for better support and frequent updates.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scala-lang.scala)**

This is my Scala syntax for VS Code and it is based on https://github.com/sellmerfud/scala.tmbundle

I decided create a new extension after problems with Scala extension from Iliya Tryapitsin.

## Features

Only scala syntax.

## Requirements

No requirements.
